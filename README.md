=Gabber-fy=
A Max/MSP facility to convert input audio to hardcore Gabber music.
==How To==
Import the ```codeoclock.gabba-fy~``` object to your patch. It requires media/kick.wav and media/snare.wav, as well as qm.btrack~, so have those in your path somewhere.
==Thanks==
Thanks to freesound.org for the gabber drum samples, and to Queen Mary Live Music Lab for the qt.btrack~ beat detection object.
